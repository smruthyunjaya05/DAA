Algorithm Steps for Bubble Sort

step 1:Start at the beginning of the list.
step 2:Compare the first two elements.
step 3:If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
step 4:Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swap steps.
step 5:Continue this process until you reach the end of the list.
step 6:Repeat the entire process for the entire list, excluding the last element each time
 (since the last element already in place).
step 7:Continue until no swaps are needed.
