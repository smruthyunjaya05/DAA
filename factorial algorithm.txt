Algorithm to Calculate Factorial of a Number
1.Input:
	Prompt the user to enter an integer n.
	Read the integer input n.
2.Initialization:
	Initialize a variable fact to store the factorial value, starting with 1.
3.Factorial Calculation Loop:
	While n is greater than 0, repeat the following steps:
	Multiply fact by n and assign the result back to fact.
	Decrement n by 1.
4.Output:
	Print the value of fact, which is the factorial of the input integer n.
