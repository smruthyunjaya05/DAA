Algorithm Steps find the GCD of two numbers
step 1:	Input the Numbers:
	Read the integers n1n1n1 and n2n2n2.
step 2:	Initialize Variables:
	Initialize a variable GCD_NumGCD\_NumGCD_Num to store the GCD.
	Initialize a loop counter iii.
step 3:	Iterate to Find Divisors:
	Loop from i=1i = 1i=1 to the minimum of n1n1n1 and n2n2n2:
	If n1mod  i==0n1 \mod i == 0n1modi==0 and n2mod  i==0n2 \mod i == 0n2modi==0:
	Set GCD_NumGCD\_NumGCD_Num to iii (store the current divisor as the GCD).
step 4:	Output the GCD:
	Print the value of GCD_NumGCD\_NumGCD_Num.
